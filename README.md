## ℹ️ House Layout Rendered with Pure CSS

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

This project is a creative visual of a house layout built entirely with semantic HTML elements and pure CSS. It demonstrates layout positioning, absolute placement, and layered background effects to create a simple house painting using code.

It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the [**freeCodeCamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) CSS course.

## 🔍 Overview

This project visualizes a minimal house with a roof, windows, a door, and a chimney using divs styled with CSS. No images or SVGs were used—just shapes created by CSS properties like width, height, background color, and borders.

It’s a purely creative exercise meant to improve positioning, layering, and component structuring skills using only front-end code, focusing heavily on absolute positioning and z-index stacking logic.
